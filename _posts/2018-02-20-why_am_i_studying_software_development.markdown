I am currently working close to minimum wage and had nearly committed towards becoming a truck driver due to expediency of earning a decent living, until I found "coding bootcamps" that teaches students on how to become software developers within 10-12 weeks on average to ALL coding bootcamps I have researched. 

Overall, I was curious and decided to try coding bootcamps based on career tests that pointed my to computer software development and my strengths of being detailed oriented based on my previous education in Accounting and Business Computing.
